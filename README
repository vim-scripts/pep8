You need to install this tool: http://github.com/cburroughs/pep8.py
It's a simple program that just checks if your python code is pep-8 compliant.

Pressing F5 will run it using the "quickfix" feature.
This way you can "navigate" through errors using :cn and other standard commands.

This is mostly copied from http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=891

To ignore certain errors add pep8_ignore to your .vimrc followed by comma seperated list of error codes. ie:
let g:pep8_ignore="E501,E128"

To change key to execute add pep8_map to your .vimrc. ie:
let g:pep8_map='<leader>8'
